# Meeting 24/10/2022

## Minutes
- Went through slides and discussed progress in the last week.
- Discussed the SocialFx dataset as well as *Word Embeddings for Automatic Equalization in Audio Mixing (2022)*.
- Talked about expectation for Interim Report:
  - Expect a pretty comprehensive literature review. Roughly 6-12 papers which are very relevant to your particular area.
  - Maybe another ~12 papers which are more general (deep learning applied to audio, various types of listening tests).
  - Should have a very good idea of what you are wanting to investigate (and why) as well as a few specific research questions which could be answered.
- Talked about expectation for implementation at end of semester 1.
  - Should be able to show that you *could* do it.
  - I.e. a proof of concept (but doesn't need to be tested etc.)
  - Think about how you would need to evaluate the performance of your model.
- Discussed ways that SocialFX and SAFE-DB could be combined? Or if they should just be treated separately.

## To-do for this week 
- Need to think about how you are going to organise your thoughts and be more specific about the final idea.
- Think about the inputs/outputs of the model and how many plugins you want to model?
- See if there is a way of applying the effects from SocialFx.
- Create figure for next week showing the *difference* in AudioCommons features of raw/effected audio rather than side by side comparison.
