# Meeting 21/11/2022

## Minutes
- Went through slides and discussed progress in the last week.
- Discussed difficulties with Style Transfer code and dataset.
- Talked about tuning number of latent factors for $z$.
  - Can just keep increasing until you reach decent amount (elbow).
  - Nothing much else you can do.
- Talked about preparation for interim report.
  - Have loose headings and clustered papers by next week.
  - Draft by week after next.
- Talked about implementing code from scratch rather than modifying existing code.
- Using simple free-to-use VSTs and selecting 'sensible values'.
  - MDA or GVST libraries.
  - % of settings that are silent/overly distorted.

## To-do for this week 
- Create interim report sketch.
  - Headings and grouped papers.
  - Think about potential risks and mitigation.
- Notebook for loading in VSTs and applying random effects, looking at what sounds good or not.
- Start reimplementing code from Style Transfer.
- See if it is possible to run training on small subset of dataset.
