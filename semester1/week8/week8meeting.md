# Meeting 07/11/2022

## Minutes
- Went through slides and discussed progress in the last week.
- Went through architecture diagram and self-supervised learning.
- Asked for feedback on project:
  - It is important to start making implementation decisions; really need to narrow down on idea for project.
  - Don't worry about doing a wide-literature review; focus on papers in your area.
  - Make sure to have a really good understanding of papers; try to preempt questions that might come up about it.
  - More diagrams/audio examples are very useful.
  - Assume report has been read, don't spend lots of time going over it at the meeting.
  - Try running more code locally, focus on:
    - Convergence rates.
    - Inference time.
    - What is the quality of the output.
    - How much data do you actually need? 
    - Where are you going to sample parameter settings from?

## To-do for this week 
- How is phase taken into account in Style Transfer architecture.
- How are biquads made to distort?
- Was there anything missed in 'hyperconditioning'.
- Look at MLOps, and specifically https://wandb.ai.
- Prepare a mental plan of where you'd like to be by Christmas. What do you need to do in the remaining weeks to get there?
- Start Neural Nets for Generating Audio series.
- Try to get Style Transfer working locally.
