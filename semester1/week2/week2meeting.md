# Meeting 26/09/2022

## Minutes
- Discussed background to project and motivation.
- Discussed project ideas and expected outcomes from the project. 

## To-do for this week 
- Read hall of fame MSci projects, understand the expected format of output for the project. 
  - Make sure to keep this in mind in order to avoid creating too much software with nothing to write about. 
- Look at potential data/unsupervised tagging for the more generative ideas for models. Is there something already out there (Freesound)?
- Spend some time making music/watching others make music. Make a note of any tools which would be useful for creativity?
- Think about end project ideas and work around that. From the meeting it sounds like want something that is intuitive and interactive?
- Start looking at some simple ML pipelines for audio (MNIST/Hello World for processing sound).
- Think about which models would be suitable for which tasks (DDSP paper had some good summaries of strengths for each model).
