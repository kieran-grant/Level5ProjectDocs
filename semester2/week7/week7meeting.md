# Meeting 20/02/2023

## Minutes
- Went through slides and discussed progress in the last week.
- Latent embeddings and change of parameters seem to work very well for VAE.
- Discussed checking parameters individually and also mapping from 3-D parameter space to 2D latent space and colour coding (look at rainbow plot).
- Choices made (and not made) about STFT parameter settings should be explained in report - might also be useful for future work.
- Audio reconstructions sound better than expected.

## To-do for this week 
- Training of end-to-end with static parameter settings for different DAFX.
  - Show convergence of parameter settings
  - Audio from trained model.
  - How well does spectrogram match?
- Visualisations as above (individual parameter plots), and rainbow-plot/colour plot of mappings from 3D parameter space to 2D latent embedding.
