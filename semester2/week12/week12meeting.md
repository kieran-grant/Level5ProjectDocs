# Meeting 27/03/2023

## Minutes
- Went through slides and discussed progress in the last week.
- Showed results from latent controller.
- Asked questions about final presentation.
- Supervisors commented that scores for latent controller are quite high. SHould think about what I would have done differently to improve this:
  - Have random space and hand-tuned space to create upper and lower bounds.
  - Have more evaluators and use user-normalisation to create comparable scores.

## To-do for this week 
- Get MUSHRA participants.
- Report writing.
