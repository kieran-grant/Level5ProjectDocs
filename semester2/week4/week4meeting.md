# Meeting 30/01/2023

## Minutes
- Went through slides and discussed progress in the last week.
- Went through different number of neighbours for UMAP - not sure why adding more datapoints makes the projections more homogenous.
- Feature extractor does not seem to be capturing the data we need.
- Jonathan mentioned that I can message mid-week. Better to send an email than to be stuck!
- Might not be worth looking too closely at reconstruction values if data seems random.

## To-do for this week 
- Try simpler dataset - test tones, more homogenous data (maybe some single instrument songs)?
- Try using UMAP on raw spectrograms.
- Continue with implementing simple VAE.
- **Don't let lack of progress in this case stall progress for the project:**
  - Keep working on report.
  - Keep working on experimentation plan.
